# hello-world
This is my first repository used for random stuff

Hey Folks!

Jonny here, I`m about to research on that fancy topic called bare-metal hypervising. 
At this point my knowlage is far down to basic information but I`m going to learn
more and more over time. So feel free to join me on my journey to my first up and 
running bare-metal hypervisor with some fancy debian guests on it! (fingers crossed)
